# Network Performance
Raw network performance was tested by a repeated series of 1GiB raw tcp
throughput tests using the iperf3 tool between a Seagate Central server
and a powerful Linux client connected to the same Gigabit Ethernet switch.

Samba performance was tested by mounting the Seagate Central under test's Public 
folder from the Linux client and repeatedly copying 1GiB files back and forth
between the client and Seagate Central server. Note that an SMBv1 style connection
was used with the original Seagate Central samba v3.5.16 and the more secure
SMBv3.11 was used with the newer samba v4.14.6. 

## Kernel Types Tested
Original : Seagate Central stock Linux kernel (2.6.35.13-cavm1.whitney-econa.whitney-econa)

v5.15.70-sc : As generated by the **Seagate-Central-Slot-In-v5.x-Kernel** project

## Samba versions tested
v3.5.16 : Original samba version included in Seagate Central Firmware (SMBv1.0)

v4.14.6 : As generated by the **Seagate-Central-Samba** project (SMBv3.11)

## Conclusion
While the original kernel's raw tcp receive speeds are clearly significantly faster
than the new kernel's, most other *important* results are not significantly
different from each other. Most notably the samba file transfer speeds from the
original system (Original Kernel + samba v3.5.16) are not significantly different
to the speeds from an upgraded system (New Kernel + samba v4.14.6). This is most 
likely due to the new SMP capability in the new kernel making the samba file server
process more efficient, despite the reduction in raw rx speeds.
